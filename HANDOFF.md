# Handoff: Saulog OS (Kain + Buhat + Quarters)

Status as of 2026-09-10. This file was rewritten from scratch on 2026-09-08 to
consolidate five rounds of same-day work into one current reference, the old
round-by-round log was getting too long to safely skim. Read this whole file
before touching this project again.

## Round 11 (2026-09-10): Kain logging was slow, food autocomplete blocked the input

Edwin reported Kain felt slow every time he logged food, and separately that the
food-name autocomplete dropdown covered up the text he was typing. Both fixed,
not yet pushed live as of this writing (tested only against a local server).

- **Root cause of the slowness: `refreshAll()` on every single log.** Every food
  save (and edit, and recipe save) called `refreshAll()`, which re-rendered all
  three tabs -- including a *live Supabase network fetch* for the Buhat Health
  card -- even though a food log never touches Buhat, Recipes, Exercises, Weight,
  or Health. Fixed four ways:
  1. `renderHealth()` now no-ops unless the Buhat panel is actually visible
     (`isBuhatActive()`), so logging food never waits on a network round trip for
     data it isn't even showing. Switching to the Buhat tab calls it again to
     catch up.
  2. `handleLogSubmit`/`saveEditedLog` now call `renderLog()` only (plus
     `renderFoodDatalist()`, but only when the entry was a genuinely new custom
     food); `handleSaveRecipe` and the recipe-delete button now touch only
     `renderRecipeDatalist()`/`renderRecipeList()`. `refreshAll()` itself is
     unchanged and still used for init() and date navigation (shiftDate) where a
     full refresh is actually correct.
  3. `logs`/`workouts`/`quarters`/`weights` all already had a `date` index in
     IndexedDB (added when each store was created) but nothing used it --
     `renderLog`/`renderWorkouts`/`renderQuarters`/`renderWeight`/
     `saveQuarterSlot` were doing `getAll()` (the *entire* history of that store)
     and filtering to `currentDate` in JS. Added `getAllByIndex`/`getByIndex`/
     `getRecentByIndex` helpers and switched all five to index lookups, so a
     render only touches today's rows. This matters most for `quarters` (up to
     96 rows/day) and will matter more for all of them the longer he uses the
     app -- the old code got slower every day, forever.
  4. `renderFoodDatalist()` (the `getAll('foods')` + sort over ~3,600 rows: 135
     curated + ~3,460 German import) is now only called on load and when a food
     is actually added to the library, not on every log/edit/delete.
- **Food-name autocomplete replaced, not just re-styled.** It was a native
  `<datalist>` (`#foodList`, shared by `#logName` and `#ingName`). iOS renders a
  `<datalist>` popup in a way that can sit on top of the input's own text while
  typing -- a known WebKit quirk, not something fixable with CSS on a native
  control. Replaced with a plain `<div class="suggest-list">` dropdown,
  absolutely positioned under the input (`.suggest-wrap` wrapper), built and
  shown/hidden entirely by `updateFoodSuggest`/`setupFoodSuggest` in app.js.
  Click-to-select uses `mousedown` + `preventDefault()` (not `click`) so
  selecting an item doesn't lose focus/get raced by the input's own `blur`.
  Verified in a local browser: typing stays fully visible with the dropdown
  cleanly below it, click-to-select fills the input and closes the list,
  keeps focus, no console errors. The `#foodList` datalist element and both
  inputs' `list=` attributes are gone; `#recipeList` and `#exerciseList`
  (workout autocomplete) are untouched -- only the food-name one was reported
  as broken and is the only one at this row count (3,600+) where a native
  control's quirks were actually visible.
- **Quarters: now opens near "now," not always at 00:00.** Edwin's ask:
  filling in 2pm shouldn't mean scrolling down from the top every time he
  reopens the tab. `renderQuarters()` rebuilds the grid's `innerHTML` from
  scratch (on init, date nav, and -- before fix #2 above -- on every food log),
  which always reset scroll to the top. Added `scrollQuartersToRelevantSlot()`:
  scrolls to today's current-time slot (rounded down to the nearest 15 min) when
  viewing today, or to the last filled-in slot when viewing a past date. Called
  at the end of `renderQuarters()`, but that alone is a no-op the very first
  time (the Quarters panel is still `display:none` at init, before any tab is
  clicked, and `scrollIntoView` does nothing on a hidden element) -- so it's
  also re-run from the tab-click handler when switching to Quarters, the same
  pattern used for the Health catch-up above. Typing into a slot itself
  (`saveQuarterSlot`) does NOT trigger a full grid re-render or re-scroll, so
  it won't fight the user mid-edit.
- **Testing note for whoever picks this up:** a live local test kept getting
  served stale HTML/JS despite hard-reloads and fresh `navigate()` calls, even
  though `curl` against the local server showed the edited files. Cause: the
  PWA's own Service Worker (`sw.js`, cache `food-tracker-v15`) was still
  controlling the tab from an earlier page load in the same session and
  intercepting navigation. `navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()` +
  `.unregister()` and `caches.keys()` + `caches.delete()` were needed before a
  reload actually picked up the changes. This is a testing-only gotcha (a real
  device visiting the live URL after a deploy will update normally, same as
  every prior round) -- not a bug in the shipped app, just a trap for local
  iteration.
- **Pushed 2026-09-10**, live on GitHub Pages within ~30-60s of the push per
  the section above.

## Read this first: do not create anything new

- **Local source:** `~/food-tracker-app` (this directory). Unchanged all day,
  only the GitHub repo name changed, never the local folder.
- **GitHub repo:** `FireSmasher/saulog-os` (public). Renamed from
  `food-tracker-app` on 2026-09-08 at Edwin's request. `git remote -v` in this
  directory already points at the new URL, `gh repo rename` updated it
  automatically, confirmed working.
- **Live URL:** **https://firesmasher.github.io/saulog-os/**: deployed via
  GitHub Pages from `main`, root path. A push goes live in ~30-60s.
- **The old URL is dead.** `https://firesmasher.github.io/food-tracker-app/`
  404s outright (confirmed by hand), GitHub Pages does not redirect a renamed
  repo's Pages site the way it redirects `git clone`/`push`. Never write that
  URL anywhere as if it still works.
- **No backend other than Supabase, no accounts beyond the one described below.**
  If a future session can't find this directory or repo, search for it
  (`gh repo view FireSmasher/saulog-os`, or look for `~/food-tracker-app`)
  before creating anything new. Do not spin up a second repo, a second GitHub
  Pages site, a second Artifact, or a second local project directory for any
  part of this, ever.

## What Saulog OS is, right now

A free, installable PWA with two tabs on the bottom nav, **Kain** (food/macro
logging, with Log and Recipes as an internal subnav) and **Buhat** (gym workout
logging), plus a Settings screen behind a gear icon in the header.

**Stack:** static site (`index.html` + `app.js` + `sw.js` service worker +
`foods.json` + `workouts.json` + self-hosted fonts), IndexedDB for all local
data, optional Supabase sync layer, no build step, no npm, deployed straight to
GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

**Storage model:** everything is written to IndexedDB on the device first
(`foods`, `recipes`, `logs`, `exercises`, `workouts` object stores,
`DB_VERSION` 2). If the user is signed into Sync (Settings → Sync), every new
food/workout log *also* write-throughs to Supabase (see below), but this is
opt-in and not signed into by default, so most of a user's history can still be
phone-only. **See the incident log below before assuming phone-only storage is
safe against every failure mode.**

**Theme:** light mode (bg `#faf7f0`, card `#ffffff`, text `#241f18`, accent
`#96723c`, danger `#b1503d`: full palette in `index.html`'s `:root`). App name
and date headers use Satoshi bold, not the Cormorant Garamond serif display font
(that's reserved for section `<h2>`s only). Ghost buttons default to a neutral
muted color; red (`.danger` class) is reserved for genuinely destructive actions
(delete ×, "Remove saved key") so Search/Tag/Close etc. don't read as
warnings. Pinch-zoom is disabled (`touch-action: pan-y` + viewport meta); all
inputs are 16px to stop iOS auto-zooming on focus.

**Icon:** `icon.png`, a 512×512 crop of a generated S-mark mockup Edwin supplied
(cropped down from a larger render that included background/shadow padding).
Name stayed "Saulog OS", Edwin confirmed, no rename needed.

### Kain (food log)

- Log tab: name/recipe autocomplete against the local `foods`/`recipes` stores,
  a "Search" button that hits USDA FoodData Central live (Settings holds an
  optional personal API key, localStorage-only, falls back to a shared 30/hr
  demo key), weight in grams, optional notes (styled smaller/muted so it reads
  as skippable), a restaurant toggle (+15% kcal/fat correction), daily
  kcal/protein/fat/carb targets rendered as progress bars.
- The old "count × weight-each" calculator is gone, removed 2026-09-08,
  Edwin said it wasn't useful.
- Recipes subtab: build a recipe from existing food-library ingredients by
  weight, save it, it becomes loggable like any food.
- **Food dataset (`foods.json`, 135 entries as of this writing):** a curated
  offline set (raw/cooked meats, staples, common Berlin/German items, döner,
  currywurst, Quark, etc.) plus specific branded products Edwin asked for by
  name. USDA's live search covers generic items far beyond the bundled list;
  it does NOT cover German retail branded products (USDA is a US database), so
  those have to be added by hand here.
  - **Branded entries added 2026-09-08, sourced by web search, not from
    Edwin's own packaging, flag this to him if he ever asks why a number
    looks off:**
    - `Heinz Mayonnaise, Das Original`: 644 kcal, 0.8g protein, 3g carb, 70g
      fat /100g. Reasonably confident (single consistent source, matches
      mayo's typical profile).
    - `Milbona High Protein Joghurt, Natur`: 92 kcal, 11.8g protein, 5.1g
      carb, 2.5g fat /100g. **Genuinely uncertain**: Milbona (Lidl's dairy
      house brand; Edwin said "Limbona," that's not a real brand) sells this
      in several flavors with different macros, and the exact "Natur"/plain
      variant's numbers couldn't be confirmed. Ask Edwin to check his tub's
      label if this ever looks wrong.
    - `Bull's-Eye Spicy Garlic Sauce`: 260 kcal, 0.9g protein, 13g carb, 22g
      fat /100g. Cross-checked against two independent sources, both agreed.
      High fat because it's oil-based, not tomato-based like standard BBQ
      sauce, don't "fix" this thinking it's an error.
  - **Open ask from Edwin, not yet acted on:** he wants a much larger set of
    Lidl products added, especially more of the meat section, and floated
    using his local Ollama to bulk-research/structure the data instead of
    Claude doing one-by-one web searches (matches his standing credit rule:
    prefer local Ollama for volume work). Proposed but not yet built:
    for *branded* packaged goods, OpenFoodFacts has a free structured API
    (real label data, no LLM guessing needed), better than either Ollama or
    Claude "searching." If Edwin or a script hands back data, the exact shape
    each entry needs is `{"name": "...", "kcal": 0, "protein": 0.0, "carb":
    0.0, "fat": 0.0}` per 100g, appended to `foods.json`. Ask him what
    specific meat items/cuts he actually wants before guessing at a big batch.

### Buhat (workout log)

- Split selector (Push/Pull/Legs/Upper/Lower/Cardio), exercise name with a
  "Tag" button, a sets builder (weight × reps), optional notes (same
  smaller/muted styling as Kain).
- **Muscle-group auto-tagging**, lookup order: local `exercises` IndexedDB
  store (seeded from `workouts.json`, 32 entries taken from Edwin's actual
  Nippard block, Pull/Push/Legs/one Cardio entry) → live wger.de lookup →
  manual prompt (asks Edwin once, remembers the answer forever after).
- **wger fix, 2026-09-08:** the endpoint the original build used
  (`/api/v2/exercise/search/`) is gone from wger's API entirely, confirmed by
  hand, it 404s. So every exercise not in the bundled 32 was silently falling
  straight to the manual prompt with the "live lookup" doing nothing. Replaced
  with wger's current endpoints: exact-name match against
  `/api/v2/exercise-translation/?name=...&language=2` (tried as typed, then
  Title-Cased), then `/api/v2/exerciseinfo/{id}` for category + secondary
  muscles (verified live: "Bench Press" → "Chest/Shoulders/Triceps"). **Real
  fix, but narrower than fuzzy search**: confirmed by hand that wger's
  `search=`/`name__icontains=` params are silent no-ops that return the whole
  ~3300-row table unfiltered, so exact-name is the only working option against
  their live API today.
- **Built, 2026-09-09: local wger name cache.** `scripts/build_wger_cache.py`
  pulls wger's full exercise list once (900 base exercises, 3138 unique
  English name translations/aliases after de-duping) into
  `wger_exercises.json`, bundled with the app like `foods.json`. `app.js`'s
  `searchWgerCache()` matches a typed name against it (exact match first,
  then substring either direction, picking the shortest/most-specific
  candidate) before ever hitting the live API, the old exact-match-only
  `searchWger()` live call is now only a last-resort fallback for exercises
  wger's added since the cache was built. Verified by hand in-browser:
  "Bulgarian split squat" (not in the bundled 32, and not an exact case
  match to wger's own naming) now auto-tags to Legs/Hamstrings with no live
  network call. Re-run the build script occasionally to pick up wger's
  newly added exercises, it's a static snapshot, not live data.

### Sync (Nippard/Sevro visibility) and targets

- Settings → Sync: real email/password login via Supabase Auth (not a PIN,
  the anon key is necessarily public in this public repo, so RLS + a real
  session is the only actual access control). When signed in, every new
  food/workout log also POSTs to Supabase (`food_logs`/`workout_logs` tables,
  RLS scoped to `auth.uid()`).
- `scripts/query-logs.py`: on-demand read path for a Nippard or Sevro
  session, using the service_role key (bypasses RLS) from a local, untracked
  `~/.saulog-os-service.json` that Edwin creates himself (Claude never reads
  its contents, only checks shape via redacting scripts). Usage:
  `python3 query-logs.py --today` or `--since YYYY-MM-DD --until YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `scripts/push-targets.py`: the Nippard → Kain direction. Pushes updated
  targets into a read-only-from-the-app `targets` table (RLS: owner can
  `select`, only `service_role` can write, there's deliberately no
  insert/update policy for `authenticated`). Usage: `python3 push-targets.py
  --kcal 2300 --protein 150 --fat 70 --carb 265`. **Needs
  `~/.saulog-os-service.json` to also carry a `"user_id"` key** (the UUID from
  Supabase → Authentication → Users), not there yet as of this writing, and
  this script has never actually been run against the live project. Don't
  trust it blind; verify a real push before relying on it.
- `app.js`'s `syncTargets()` pulls from that `targets` table on init (if
  already signed in) and after sign-in, overwriting in-memory `TARGETS` and
  caching to `localStorage` (`saulog_targets`) so it still works offline after
  the first sync. `DEFAULT_TARGETS` (2300/150/70/265, Nippard's numbers as of
  14 Aug 2026) is only the last-resort fallback if nothing's ever synced.

## ⚠ Incident, 2026-09-08: Edwin's local logs were lost

**What happened:** Edwin had been using the app (added to his iPhone home
screen, pointed at the old `food-tracker-app` URL) with real food/workout
logs. After the GitHub rename, he was told to remove that home-screen icon and
re-add one pointed at the new `saulog-os` URL. After doing that, his previous
logs were gone.

**Root cause, best understanding:** iOS gives a "standalone" home-screen web
app (added via Share → Add to Home Screen) its own **isolated storage
container**, separate from regular Safari browsing *and* separate from any
previous home-screen install of the same site. This is a known, long-standing
WebKit quirk, not something specific to this app. Removing the old icon very
likely deleted (or orphaned beyond reach) the IndexedDB data tied to that
specific install. The theory that "IndexedDB is scoped by origin, not by URL
path, so the old and new paths would share storage", which is what Edwin was
told before this happened, **turned out not to be the operative factor**; the
home-screen-install boundary matters more than the origin-vs-path one in this
context.

**Checked and ruled out as a recovery path:** queried Supabase directly
(`scripts/query-logs.py --since 2026-08-01 --until 2026-09-08`), came back
empty for both tables. Edwin was never signed into Sync during his actual
day-to-day phone use, so there was no cloud backup to fall back on. As of this
writing it's unconfirmed whether checking a plain Safari tab (not the
home-screen icon) turns up anything, that was suggested to Edwin as a last
diagnostic, result not yet reported back.

**Why this matters for whoever picks this up next:**
- **Never tell Edwin (or anyone) to remove and re-add a home-screen PWA icon
  without warning that it can wipe local data first.** This is now a known
  risk, not a theoretical one.
- The strongest actual mitigation is getting Edwin to sign into Sync as his
  normal mode of use, not an optional extra, that makes Supabase a real
  backup independent of whatever iOS does to local storage next time.
  **Update, same evening:** confirmed via `scripts/query-logs.py --today`
  that he's now signed in and actively syncing, 5 food logs and a full
  5-exercise Push workout from tonight both round-tripped to Supabase. Don't
  re-raise this as an open ask; it's done. If a future `query-logs.py` check
  ever comes back empty for a day he says he logged, that's the signal he's
  fallen back to signed-out/local-only and it's worth surfacing again.
- The "no offline sync queue" known limitation (see below) is a related but
  distinct gap, that one's about logs made while offline never syncing
  retroactively, not about local storage being wiped outright.

## Known limitations (current, not historical)

- ~~`supabase/schema.sql` not yet run against the live project~~ **DONE
  2026-09-09.** Edwin ran it; all seven tables verified reachable via
  `query-logs.py` (`quarters_logs`, `weight_logs`, `health_logs`,
  `strava_activities` all return `[]` rather than 404). Two bugs surfaced
  and were fixed in the process, see Round 9 below.
- **Apple Health Shortcut half-built, paused 2026-09-09 evening.** Walkthrough
  at `docs/apple-health-shortcut.md`. It is genuinely close, do NOT restart it
  from scratch. What's already correct in the Shortcut on his phone:
  - Both `Get Contents of URL` actions, with the right URLs (auth token
    endpoint, and `health_logs?on_conflict=user_id,date`)
  - Both set to POST; all four headers on the write action (`apikey`,
    `Authorization: Bearer` + the Dictionary Value variable, `Content-Type`,
    `Prefer`); `apikey` + `Content-Type` on the auth action
  - Auth JSON body with his `email` and `password`
  - `Get Dictionary Value` for `access_token`, correctly wired
  - A `steps` field exists in the write body, as a Number

  Three things left, ~6 taps: (1) `Find Health Samples` (Type is Steps, Start
  Date is today) and `Calculate Statistics` (Sum) got deleted at some point
  and need re-adding **at the top**, before the auth action; (2) the `steps`
  body field needs its value pointed at that Sum's output variable; (3) the
  `Prefer` header value has a typo, reads `resolution=marge-duplicates`, must
  be `merge`.

  He does NOT need to send a `date`. `health_logs.date` now defaults to
  today in Europe/Berlin, verified by a live test insert.

  **Researched 2026-09-09 after he called the manual build a waste of his
  evening. Conclusions, so nobody re-runs this research:**
  - **The two Health actions can only be added on the iPhone. This is a hard
    floor, not a preference.** macOS has no HealthKit, and the Mac Shortcuts
    action library has no Health category at all (verified by hand: it lists
    Controls/Device/Location/Media/Sharing/Documents/Web/Scripting, nothing
    else). No amount of Mac-side automation removes those ~6 taps.
  - **His Mac CAN see and edit the shortcut**, though. iCloud Shortcuts sync
    is on: `shortcuts list` on the Mac shows his half-built one (named "Get
    Contents of URL", since it was never renamed), and `shortcuts view <name>`
    opens it. Anything edited on the Mac syncs back to the phone.
    `/usr/bin/shortcuts` exists, with run/list/view/sign subcommands.
  - **But synthetic keystrokes don't land in Shortcuts.app's fields.** Clicks
    register via System Events; typed text does not reach the action search
    box. Also, walking the app's accessibility tree (`entire contents of
    window 1`) hangs past 120s, far too large to enumerate. So Mac-side GUI
    automation of Shortcuts is not a viable route either.
  - **iPhone Mirroring is out** (EU region block, see Round 10).
  - **Generating a `.shortcut` file is a no-go.** Action identifiers and
    UUID variable-wiring are undocumented and fail silently; the maintained
    library for it (`shortcuts-js`) was archived Aug 2024 and predates the
    signing requirement. macOS `shortcuts sign --mode anyone` does exist and
    would handle signing, but authoring a valid plist blind is the rabbit
    hole, not the signing.
  - **Health Auto Export** (App Store, by Lybron) does support custom HTTP
    headers and a daily background schedule, confirmed from its own docs. Two
    catches: automated REST export needs its Premium tier (~$25 lifetime, or
    a subscription), and its JSON body is a fixed nested `metrics`/`workouts`
    envelope that can't be remapped to our column names, so it would need the
    Edge Function below as a reshaper. Worth revisiting only if he ever wants
    to drop Shortcuts entirely.
  - **`supabase/functions/health-ingest/index.ts` is written and ready** but
    NOT deployed. It accepts one POST carrying an `X-Shared-Secret` header and
    upserts the row server-side with the service-role key. Deploying it would
    let the Shortcut drop its two auth actions and, more importantly, get his
    Supabase account password off his phone. Confirmed deployable entirely
    from the dashboard (Edge Functions, Deploy a new function, Via Editor;
    secrets under Project Settings, Edge Functions, Secrets; "Enforce JWT
    Verification" toggled off on the function's Details page). No CLI needed,
    which matters because he has none. Free tier is 500k invocations/month.
    **Be honest about its value if offering it: it does NOT reduce the
    phone-side work, because the Health actions are needed either way. It is
    a security improvement, not a shortcut to finishing.**
- **Strava is a dead end, don't re-propose it.** 2026-09-09: Edwin went to
  register the API app and found Strava now requires a paid subscription for
  API access. He isn't subscribing, and said he relies on Apple Health and
  Fitness anyway. The in-app Strava card was removed the same day;
  `scripts/sync_strava.py`, the `strava_activities` table (already created in
  the live DB, empty) and `docs/strava-setup.md` are dormant, not deleted, in
  case that ever changes. Nothing reads or writes them.
- **No offline sync queue.** A log made while offline or signed out stays
  local-only until it syncs on its own, there's no outbox/retry mechanism
  that catches up later in the same session. Scope call, not an oversight.
- ~~push-targets.py is unverified against a live push~~ **DONE 2026-09-09.**
  `user_id` added to `~/.saulog-os-service.json`, and a real push of
  2300/150/70/265 returned the written row. The Nippard -> Kain targets
  direction is now proven end to end, not just written.
- **Kain's food dataset has real, known gaps**: specifically more Lidl
  products, especially meat-section items Edwin hasn't specified yet.
- **iOS home-screen storage is fragile**: see incident above. Nothing has
  been built yet to make this more resilient beyond "sign into Sync."

## Setup reference: Supabase project

Project: "FireSmasher's Project" in org "FireSmasher's Org", ref
`dmyelqbeifdirjpqvhsl`, region `eu-west-1`, plain Postgres. Data API on,
"automatically expose new tables" **off**, automatic RLS on. Uses Supabase's
newer key format (`sb_publishable_...` / `sb_secret_...`), not legacy JWT
anon/service_role, the app's hand-written `fetch` calls (no SDK, avoids a new
CSP `script-src` entry) work the same with either format.

**If this project is ever rebuilt from scratch against a fresh Supabase
project**, remember: turning off "automatically expose new tables" also
withholds the baseline table-level GRANTs that `service_role`/`authenticated`
need before RLS policies are even evaluated (RLS restricts access, it doesn't
grant it). `supabase/schema.sql` includes the necessary `grant select, insert,
update, delete on ... to authenticated, service_role;` lines at the bottom,
don't skip them, a fresh project without them fails every query with Postgres
`42501 permission denied` even with valid credentials.

One user exists: `fortsaulog@gmail.com`, Email provider. `config.js` holds the
public project URL + publishable key (safe to be public, RLS is the actual
gate). `~/.saulog-os-service.json` (local, untracked, Edwin-created-only) holds
`supabase_url` + `service_role_key`, and needs a `user_id` key added before
`push-targets.py` will work.

## Relevant memory entries

- `edwin_nippard_system`: canonical training/nutrition system, authoritative
  source for targets and training structure.
- `edwin_diet_targets`: where the 2,300/150/70/265 numbers came from.
- `edwin_credential_boundary`: the standing rule that shaped this app's
  privacy model and why Claude never reads `~/.saulog-os-service.json`'s
  actual key values.
- `sevro_identity`: Sevro's own architecture, relevant to the read side of
  the Nippard/Sevro integration.
- `saulog_os_handoff`: the auto-memory pointer to this project; keep it in
  sync with this file's "current state," don't let them drift.

## Condensed changelog (same day, 2026-09-08)

1. **Round 1, built the four-piece ask.** Renamed to Saulog OS, built Buhat
   from scratch, exercise auto-tagging via bundled dictionary, Supabase sync
   layer (Option C, Edwin's explicit pick over an Artifact-based approach).
   End-to-end verified: Edwin signed in and logged one real food + workout
   entry on his phone, confirmed round-tripping through Supabase.
2. **Round 2, nav restructure, undo, no-zoom, wger fix, targets sync-back.**
   Kain/Buhat-only bottom nav with Settings moved to a gear icon, soft-delete
   with a 5s undo toast, pinch-zoom disabled, discovered and fixed wger's dead
   search endpoint, added the read-only `targets` table + `push-targets.py`.
3. **Round 3, light theme, UX cleanup.** Full light-mode palette, Satoshi
   bold name/date, neutral-by-default ghost buttons with red reserved for
   `.danger`, muted smaller Notes styling, removed the count×weight-each
   calculator, cleared em dashes from app copy.
4. **Round 4, icon + GitHub rename.** Replaced `icon.png` with Edwin's
   generated mockup (cropped to a clean tile), kept the name "Saulog OS,"
   renamed the GitHub repo from `food-tracker-app` to `saulog-os` at Edwin's
   request (old Pages URL now dead, confirmed).
5. **Round 5, food additions, then the storage incident.** Added Heinz Mayo,
   Milbona yogurt, Bull's-Eye sauce to `foods.json` (web-search sourced, some
   uncertainty flagged). Edwin reported his prior logs gone after removing/
   re-adding the home-screen icon, see incident log above. He's now testing
   fresh logging in the actual installed app (not a Safari tab) to confirm the
   new install persists correctly; awaiting his confirmation.
6. **Round 6 (2026-09-09), mislabeled fruit fix, weight hints, edit-a-log.**
   Edwin logged mandarins as "Orange" (240g) because there was no Mandarin
   entry and no easy way to size fruit without a scale. Added `Mandarin` to
   `foods.json` and corrected the already-synced Supabase row by hand
   (`id a8a76989-...`) to the new name/macros, local IndexedDB on his phone
   still shows the old "Orange" entry until he edits or re-logs it, this was
   a one-off Supabase patch, not a full fix. Added `TYPICAL_WEIGHTS` reference
   hints (small/medium/large gram estimates) shown under the grams field for
   banana/orange/mandarin/apple/avocado, still logs by grams, just gives a
   starting point instead of a blind guess. Added an **Edit** button on each
   log entry (`startEditLog`/`saveEditedLog`/`syncUpdate` in `app.js`) so a
   wrong name/grams/notes can be corrected in place instead of delete-and-
   relog, updates IndexedDB and, if synced, PATCHes the Supabase row.
7. **Round 7 (2026-09-09), German food import, barcode scan, Quarters tab,
   body weight, Health/Strava bridges.** Big one, several distinct asks in the
   same session:
   - **German retailer food import.** `scripts/import_off_foods.py` pulls
     OpenFoodFacts data tagged Lidl/Rewe/Edeka/Netto (in that priority order,
     Edwin's call), dedupes by barcode, caps at 5,000, landed 3,462 usable
     entries (`germany_foods.json`) since OFF's public API was flaky (rolling
     503/401s) and cut Netto (lowest priority) short; Lidl/Rewe/Edeka got
     through mostly intact. Imported once into IndexedDB via
     `seedGermanFoodsIfEmpty()`, gated by a `localStorage` flag so it doesn't
     re-diff 3,462 rows on every launch like the small curated `foods.json`
     does. `renderFoodDatalist`/`filterFoodDatalist` were changed to filter
     on typing (max 60 shown) instead of dumping every row into the
     `<datalist>`: that broke down at this scale.
   - **Barcode scanning.** `html5-qrcode` (cdnjs) reads EAN/UPC codes via the
     camera; looks up the local `foods` store by a new `barcode` index first
     (DB bumped to v3 for this), falls back to a live OpenFoodFacts product
     lookup and adds a hit to the library. CSP updated: `script-src` now
     allows `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `connect-src` allows
     `world.openfoodfacts.org`, `img-src` allows `blob:` for the camera feed.
   - **Quarters tab (DB v4).** The old Quarters Claude Artifact
     (`~/quarters/quarters.html`) is rebuilt as a third bottom-nav tab here,
     fresh start per Edwin's call, pre-migration days stay archived in the
     old Artifact, not backfilled. 96 slots/day, military time, `00:00`
     first slot. Category rules (`Q_RULES` in `app.js`) are a byte-for-byte
     copy of the original `RULES` array so a label categorizes the same way
     in both places. Edwin's own convention of comma-separating multiple
     things done in one 15-min slot ("Duolingo, breakfast") is parsed and
     each piece categorized separately (`qSplitActivities`); a multi-activity
     slot's 15 minutes gets split proportionally across those categories in
     the day summary rather than assigned whole to just the first one. Synced
     to a new `quarters_logs` Supabase table (needs the updated
     `supabase/schema.sql` run manually). **No midnight "finalize" job**: iOS
     won't reliably run background JS for a home-screen PWA at a fixed time,
     so the day summary (category totals + activity list) is computed live
     on read instead, same result without depending on a timer that might
     not fire.
   - **Body weight (Buhat, DB v5).** One entry per day, `weight_logs` table,
     small form above the workout log, closes the gap that food/workout/
     time logs didn't connect to the actual recomp outcome measure.
   - **Apple Health and Strava bridges, plumbing only.** Neither can be built
     from inside this PWA (HealthKit isn't reachable from Safari at all;
     Strava needs an OAuth app only Edwin can register). Added `health_logs`
     and `strava_activities` tables plus `scripts/sync_strava.py`, and wrote
     `docs/apple-health-shortcut.md` / `docs/strava-setup.md` as exact
     walkthroughs for the phone-side/browser-side setup steps only Edwin can
     do. Nothing in the app displays `health_logs` or `strava_activities`
     yet, they're queryable via `query-logs.py --table health_logs` etc.,
     not shown in the UI. Ask specifically if an in-app view is wanted.
   - `query-logs.py` now reads `quarters_logs` and `weight_logs` too (default
     `--table both` covers all four); both Nippard's and Sevro's
     `SAULOG_OS_SYNC.md` copies updated to mention Quarters.
   - **Outstanding: `supabase/schema.sql` has NOT been run against the live
     project.** `quarters_logs`, `weight_logs`, `health_logs`, and
     `strava_activities` don't exist in Supabase yet, Edwin needs to run the
     updated file in the SQL editor before any of these sync for real
     (IndexedDB/local will still work, sync will silently no-op until then,
     same graceful-degradation behavior as any other offline case).
8. **Round 8 (2026-09-09), wger local cache, in-app Health/Strava view, a
   schema grant bug caught before it shipped.**
   - **wger local cache**, described above under Buhat.
   - **In-app Health/Strava view.** Buhat now has a "Health & Strava" section
     below the workout log (`#healthStravaSection` in `index.html`,
     `renderHealthStrava()` in `app.js`), read-only, since both tables are
     written entirely from outside the app (the Health Shortcut, `sync_strava.py`).
     Hidden entirely when signed out (there's nothing to show, neither
     source can write without a real session). Shows today's steps/sleep
     from `health_logs` and the current day's Strava activities from
     `strava_activities`, both scoped to the same date the Buhat date-nav is
     on. Wired into `refreshAll()`, `shiftDate()`, sign-in, and sign-out so it
     stays in sync with the rest of the day-based UI. Verified in a local
     browser test (signed-out state correctly hides the section, no console
     errors), not yet verified signed-in with real data, since the schema
     migration this depends on hadn't been run yet at the time of this build.
   - **Caught while building the above: `strava_activities` was missing its
     `grant` line in `supabase/schema.sql`**: RLS policies existed but no
     baseline table-level grant, the exact bug this file already warned about
     for a different table (see "Setup reference: Supabase project" below).
     Would have hit both `sync_strava.py` (service_role) and the new in-app
     view (authenticated) with a `42501 permission denied` the moment the
     schema was run. Fixed before Edwin ran the migration.
   - Sanity-checked: `node --check app.js` passes, app loads and logs cleanly
     in a local browser smoke test, `git status` clean going into this round.
9. **Round 9 (2026-09-09), schema actually run, two bugs it exposed.**
   Edwin ran `supabase/schema.sql` in the SQL editor. It failed twice before
   succeeding, both times for real reasons worth remembering:
   - **`create policy` is not idempotent.** Postgres has no
     `create policy if not exists`, so re-running the file against a project
     that already had `food_logs`/`workout_logs`/`targets` set up died with
     `42710: policy "food_logs: owner select" already exists`. Fixed by
     preceding all 25 policies with `drop policy if exists`. The file is now
     genuinely safe to re-run; the header says so. Note this makes Supabase's
     SQL editor show a "Potential issue detected: destructive operations"
     warning, that's triggered by the word `drop` alone, and the file
     contains no `drop table`/`delete`/`truncate`/`drop column` at all
     (verified by grep). A dropped policy is re-created on the very next line,
     and a table with RLS on and no policy fails *closed*, never open.
   - **`query-logs.py` hardcoded `order=date.asc,time.asc` for every table.**
     Only `food_logs`/`workout_logs`/`quarters_logs` have a `time` column, so
     the three new tables 400'd with `42703: column ... does not exist` the
     moment they became reachable. This is why the script "worked" before:
     the tables didn't exist, so a 404 masked the ordering bug behind it.
     Fixed with a `TABLES_WITH_TIME` set, falling back to `created_at.asc`.
     All six log tables verified reading cleanly afterwards.
   - Still outstanding after this round: `user_id` in
     `~/.saulog-os-service.json` (blocks `push-targets.py` and
     `sync_strava.py`), the Apple Health Shortcut, and Strava OAuth.
10. **Round 10 (2026-09-09), user_id added, targets verified live, Strava
    killed.**
    - `user_id` written into `~/.saulog-os-service.json` (Edwin sent the UID
      directly; a UID is an identifier, not a credential, and grants nothing
      without the service_role_key, which stays unread as always).
    - **`push-targets.py` verified against a live push for the first time**,
      pushing 2300/150/70/265 and getting the written row back. That script
      had been shipped-but-unproven since it was written.
    - **Strava dropped.** Edwin found API access is now subscriber-only. The
      in-app card was removed (`renderHealthStrava` -> `renderHealth`, Strava
      markup deleted from `index.html`) rather than left to display "No
      Strava activity" forever on a screen he uses daily. Backend left
      dormant. He noted he relies on Apple Health/Fitness anyway, so that's
      where any further integration effort should go.
    - **health_logs expanded to six fields** on his pick: `steps`,
      `sleep_hours`, `active_energy_kcal`, `exercise_minutes`, `workout_type`,
      `resting_hr`. Added as `alter table ... add column if not exists` since
      the table already existed live.
    - **`health_logs.date` now defaults to `(now() at time zone
      'Europe/Berlin')::date`**, so the Shortcut doesn't have to compute and
      send a date. This deleted two fiddly phone-side actions (Format Date
      plus a custom format string that had already been typed wrong as
      `yyy-MM-dd`). Verified with a live insert-then-delete: a row posted
      with no date came back dated 2026-09-09.
    - **`schema.sql` was run three times total this session** and is now
      genuinely idempotent. It's the fastest loop we found: `cat
      supabase/schema.sql | pbcopy` on the Mac, then Cmd+A / Cmd+V / Run in
      the SQL editor. Use that rather than telling him to open the file.
    - **iPhone Mirroring is not an option, don't propose it.** Tried it this
      session to drive his phone from the Mac: macOS has the app, and
      `screencapture` + `osascript`/System Events both work on his machine
      (UI scripting permission is granted, so a future session genuinely can
      see and click the Mac screen). But iPhone Mirroring itself refuses with
      "not available in your country or region", Apple doesn't ship it in
      the EU. There is no path from this Mac to that phone's screen.
